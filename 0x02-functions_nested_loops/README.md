# **C - Functions, nested loops**

In this project, I learned about nested loops, header files, and variable scope in C while practicing declaring and defining my own functions.

## **Test** :heavy_check_mark:
  * [test](https://github.com/6godpro/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/test): Folder of test files, created by [me](https://github.com/6godpro).
  
## **_Putchar.c** :scroll:
  * [_putchar.c](https://github.com/6godpro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/_putchar.c): C function that writes a single character to `stdout`.
  
## **Header** File :file_folder:
  * [main.h](https://github.com/6godpro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/main.h): contains prototypes for all functions written in this project.
